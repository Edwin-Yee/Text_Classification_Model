Here is a link to the text classification model that I created in google colab:

The runtime of the training section is about 1 second.
The runtime of the testing section is approximately 1 minute. 
The model categorizes a given news headline into one of four categories (world, sports, business, sci/tech) with precision of around 87%.
It is trained on 96,000 headlines and tested on 24,000 headlines (80/20 train test split).
